As many of you may know tensorflow is an incredibly popular library for building neural networks in python. Tensorlow also has a sub-library specificalyl made for TinyML called Tensorflow Lite Micro or TFML for short with [main page](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers) and [Github](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro) .  I suggest reading through the documentation on the main page and cloning the Github to your machine if you have the space since many of the fucntions in TFLM build upon other sub-libraries from the tensorflow github which both expands the capability of the library but makes it quite abstracted.
