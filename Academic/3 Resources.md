## Educational Resources:

### UPenn full course:

UPenn lectures are very beggienr friendly and you do not need to have a strong background in ML or computer engineering to get started, all of the course material including colab notebooks and HW/exercises are included.

[Main UPenn course website](https://tinyml.seas.upenn.edu/)

### MIT full course:

MIT course is definitely a step above but actually gets into the nitty-gritty of TinyML and will give you a deep appreciation for all of the "tricks" and background processes that make TinyML so special.

MIT's Han lab focuses on TinyML and hardware optimization and you can find many of their research, papers, resources etc. on their website:

## General resources

### TinyML Org.

TinyML Org is like the main TinyML and edge computing foundation that has compiled a good amount of resources and hosts yearly talks. They also have a good amount of youtube videos from past speakers that are worth looking into if you want to learn more about specific subfields of TinyML:

## Applied Resources

For the applied portion of this dev team we will be using an ESP type microcontroller with an Esspressif chip and the tensorflow workflow since it is built upon the main ternsorflow library which many of you might be familiar with and because it is open source, for the hardware IDE we will be either using the Arduino IDE or the
