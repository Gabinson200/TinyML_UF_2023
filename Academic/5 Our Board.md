We will be using the ESP32 freenove Wrover board. Lets break down the name and what exactly this board can do: Freenove is the manufacturer of the actual board with the pins, circuitry, port etc. while the chip, the brain of the board, is the [ESP32WROVER-E](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wrover-e_esp32-wrover-ie_datasheet_en.pdf) chip with associated [Github](https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_ESP32_WROVER_Board).  This board is a good medium as the chip allows for AI development while the board itself is relatively cheap and [commercially available](https://www.amazon.com/Freenove-ESP32-WROVER-Bluetooth-Compatible-Tutorials/dp/B09BC5CNHM) . Plus comes with an onboard camera and many GPIO pins. The following [introductory tutorial](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/getting-started-freenove-esp32-wrover-cam/)may be useful when starting off with the board.
